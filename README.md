## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd <project-folder>
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start a development server and open your project in the browser. Any changes you make will automatically reload the page.

4. **Build for production**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This will generate an optimized production build in the `dist` folder.

5. **Preview the production build**:
    ```bash
    npm run preview
    ```
    This will serve the production build locally, allowing you to verify it before deployment.
